scripts to work with eos programms


To start gasd calculation in directory DIR we have to get scripts/gasd/gasd.mk from
https://github.com/pyal/eos_scripts.git
and store it as
DIR/scripts/gasd.mk

After that to update scripts and matters have to run:
make -f scripts/gasd.mk updatescript.dst

It will upload files from git repo, install directories: DIR/matters ; DIR/run
Upload scripts to DIR/scripts
Create directory DIR/git - with git content

cp git/eos_scripts/scripts/gasd/gasd.cfg .
This will copy gasd.cfg file with calculation configuratrion examples to DIR/gasd.cfg

To calculate configuration [ D2 ] from [ gasd.cfg ] do:
BASE=D2 CFGFILE=gasd.cfg make -f scripts/gasd.mk run.dst
